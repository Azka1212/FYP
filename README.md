# PTSD-Prediction-Tool
Development of a PTSD predictor is a major turning point in history of physiatrist departments of this world. People are suffering from mental problems because of being the part of disable society and families. When a person is not mentally stable, in situations like these; not only that specific human being suffers but the people around him. Solution to this problem is very vast, that cannot be completed in this project but we are developing a PTSD prediction tool. PTSD basically is a type of depression from which people suffers when they face or experience traumatic events such as war, natural disaster, a serious accident, sextual abuse and any kind of traumatic event that is not easy to forget. We are using technology to serve humanity by doing the project “Neural Networks based Prediction of PTSD by analyzing textual data”. PTSD prediction tools have already been developed but their efficiency level is less than 89%. A tool having less than 90% efficiency cannot be used in hospitals. So, we are developing a Tool which will have efficiency of more than 90%. We are using all textual data of PTSD patients, that we can get from the environment and then we will train a neural network model on the dataset to train the model. So that when we give the data of new patient to it, it can predict whether that patient has PTSD or not.
